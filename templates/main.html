    <h2>Rules of the game</h2>
    <p> The goal of the game is to get to the finish line. <br>
         We have built difficult obstacles to make the game more exciting. <br>
         If you fall off, you can always go back and try again. <br> 
         The right arrow key is for running to the right and the left key is for running to the left. <br>
         The space bar is for jumping.
